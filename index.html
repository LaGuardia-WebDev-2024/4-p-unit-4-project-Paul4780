      I've never gone on any hikes because where I live theres nowhere that has
      good views at the top. However Switzerland is made for hikes and great
      scenery.

    <h2>The World Famous Chocolate and Cheese</h2>

      As someone who has a sweet tooth and hearing about a country who is famous
      for the best type of sweet it makes me want to go there that much more.

      Ive only went skiing once with my family when I was in elementary school
      and I dont remember it well but I remeber the joy of going faster than I
      ever have before on my own two feet. With how much older I am now theres
      no way that I wouldnt have even more fun than when I was a little kid.
